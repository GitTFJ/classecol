classecol is a package to perform text classiÔ¨Åcations of twitter data (but may be useful for any social media text). It provides a series of functions to clean data, can produce a sentiment matrix (including 11 popular sentiment classiffication methods) to describe the polarity of the text, and contains three text classification models: 1) hunting - assesses if the tweet is related to hunting and can determine their stance on hunting. 2) nature - which can assess if the tweet is related to nature, wildlife, or the envionment, and can describe whether the text is showing interest or concern. 3) bio - to assess if the twitter user is a person, environmental expert, or something else.
